## 1. How did you get the name Lamboginny?

That started from the fact that he was a marine engineer and he was always travelling.  When he was home he would like ot relax and I would be all over him. One day he was trying to distract me and sent me to do some chores, the speed at which I did them and came back made him ask if I was now as fast as a Lamborghini automobile. Within the house my name became Lamboginny.  Even friends in school called me that. When I went into music, I just stuck with the name and when I lost my dad, the name meant something special to me because of the bond we had.

## 2. What made you want to be a musician?

I wanted to be able to use my voice to impact the world positively.  To make people happy and to bring joy to everyone regardless of religion, class, culture, or creed.  

## 3. Who are your musical role models?

Bob Marley, Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Fela Kuti (king of afro beat in Nigeria), Elephant Man, and Lucky Dube.

## 4. What is your vision for your music?

It should be accessable to all and serve as a platform for my humanitrian efforts.

## 5. Who are some artists your have collaborated with?

Over the years I have worked with artists such as Elephant Man from Jamaica, Stone Boy from Ghana, Olamide from Nigeria, Peter of Psqare, Korede Bello, Chidinma, Yemi Alade, Small Doctor, DJ Jimmy Jatt, Muna, Mz Kiss, Mike Aremu, Mr. Clayy, and many others. 

## 6. How did you get become a prison ambassador?

I decided I wanted to perform inside of a prison.  After the performance, the Controller General of the Nigerian prison service, Olushola Ogundipe, saw the impact I had on the inmates and decided to make me the first ever prison ambasador.   

## 7. Later you became the Ambassador for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency.  How did you get involved in drug prevention?

The drug agency saw what I was doing in the prisons and approched me to use my platform to advodate against illicit drug usage and abuse.  Which I saw as an opportunity to further spread my ability to impact lives, so I accepted and became the first ever anti-drug ambassador for Nigeria.

## 8. You don't drink or smoke, what else won't you do?

You can never catch me doing a song with dirty lyrics, which is not what I represent. I can do a dance track or a love track but not a dirty track.
