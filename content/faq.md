## 1. How did you get the name Lamboginny?

That started from the fact that he was a marine engineer and he was always travelling.  When he was home he would like ot relax and I would be all over him. One day he was trying to distract me and sent me to do some chores, the speed at which I did them and came back made him ask if I was now as fast as a Lamborghini automobile. Within the house my name became Lamboginny.  Even friends in school called me that. When I went into music, I just stuck with the name and when I lost my dad, the name meant something special to me because of the bond we had.

## 2. What made you want to be a musician?




## 3. How did you get become a prison ambassador?


## 9. You don't drink or smoke, what else won't you do?

You can never catch me doing a song with dirty lyrics, which is not what I represent. I can do a dance track or a love track but not a dirty track.
