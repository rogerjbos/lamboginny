      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>1. How did you get the name Lamboginny? That started from the fact that he was a marine engineer and he was always travelling. When he was home he would like ot relax and I would be all over him. One day he was trying to distract me and sent me to do some chores, the speed at which I did them and came back made him ask if I was now as fast as a Lamborghini automobile.</description>
